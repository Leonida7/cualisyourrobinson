<h2><u><b>Background of System</h2></u></b>

<h3>Context:</h3>
	<p>Founded by Henry E. And Arabella Huntington in 1919 as a private independent institution, with the library opening to the public in 1928. The library remains one of the largest independent library institutions nationally. The library aims to provide information on America and British history/culture through preserved historically accurate documents, art, and nature. The digital library only holds a portion of the physical library's content</p>

<h4>Users:</h4>
	<p>The Digital Library aims to reach a broader audience, and hosts the library's digitized materials. A smaller amount of the library is available in the digital library as compared to the physical library. As there are physical locations to the Huntington Library, the digital is able to serve folks that are wanting to use Huntington as a resource, and not able to access its resources in person.</p>

<h7>Discussion of System</h7>

<p>Huntington Library offers a variety of sources and research. Their catalog stands out with the expansive centuries old history that is available for people to look at. The library does fall short in its digital catalog as it is a great deal smaller than their in-person library resources and in-person experience. The Huntington Library does seem to also exist as a museum of sorts, and there is a lot to gain from going in person, but that option is not easily accessible, so one could argue that the Huntington Library is better experienced in person rather than digitally. The digital is still a great source for doing research on topics that are available in their collections and catalog. For improvements to the digital library, I would consider changing the layout and make it more appealing to the eye. It could be a little more bright, the webpage, perhaps add a little more color or contrast to the green and gray. I think maybe a yellow in there could be a nice addition. I would also say that a little more emphasis on what the document is, and what it pertains before clicking on it. I think highlighting keywords, and having more keywords available in the descriptions. The pros are the site is easy to navigate, and there is a lot of information available.</p>
